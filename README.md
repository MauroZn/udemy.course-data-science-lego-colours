## Assignment
Today we're going to be diving deep into a dataset all about LEGO, which will help us answer a whole bunch of interesting questions about the history of the company, their product offering, and which LEGO set rules them all:
- What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?
- In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?
- Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it Harry Potter, Ninjago, Friends or something else?
- When did the LEGO company really take-off based on its product offering? How many themes and sets did it release every year?
- Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?
